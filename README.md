# WeAround - Cloud and Geo-Location Based Social Network

## Description
The back-end that powers the WeAround social network
The front-end implementation can be found at [WeAround-Web](https://github.com/publicclassoverflow/WeAround-Web)

The server side is hosted with a [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/coollime/app_wearound) and is deployed on Google Cloud. Deployment on GKE has been tested. Although fully functioning, deployment has been kept on GCE to save money and be environmental friendly.
